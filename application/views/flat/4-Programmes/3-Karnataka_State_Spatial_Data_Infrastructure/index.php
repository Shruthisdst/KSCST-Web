<p>Karnataka State Spatial Data Infrastructure (KSSDI) was awarded Geospatial Excellence Award for the year 2014 for establishing a citizen centric KSSDI portal and for effectively disseminating geospatial information to all users. This was awarded at India Geospatial Forum 2015 event held on 10th February 2015 at Hyderabad.</p>
<p>Dr. Shailesh Nayak, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India gave away the Certificate and memento to Shri H. Hemanth Kumar, Principal Investigator, KSSDI Programme &amp; Dr. M. Prithviraj, Executive Secretary, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology (KSCST). The award is given to KSCST and DST-GOI.</p>
<h3>Objective of the Project</h3>
<ul>
	<li class="gap-above-small">To develop a web based Geo Portal to acquire, process, store, distribute and improve the utilization of geo spatial data.</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">Data clearing house which would be a gateway of spatial data being generated by various agencies in the State.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Under a joint project of Natural Resources Data Management System (NRDMS) of Department of Science &amp; Technology, Government of India, and the Government of Karnataka, Karnataka State Council for Science &amp; Technology (KSCST), Bangalore has developed district level GIS databases to support the process of Local Level Planning at the levels of district, taluk and village. Each District Database contains spatial and attribute data sets useful in local level planning processes in the sectors of Natural Resources, Demography, Agro-economy, Socio-economy and Infrastructure facilities. Respective Zilla Panchayaths and Line Departments have been depending upon the databases for meeting their data requirements.</p>
<p>Over the past one and a half decade all the twenty nine districts of Karnataka State have been covered under NRDMS. With increasing dependence of the Zilla Panchayaths/Urban local bodies, Line Departments and other stake-holders of local level planning on spatial datasets, a need has been felt to speed up the process of discovery of and access to up-to-date spatial datasets.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Karnataka state has a rich "base" of map information in digital format at district level generated/created by various national/state government organizations through topographic surveys, geological surveys, soil surveys, cadastral surveys, various natural resources inventory programmes and the use of the remote sensing images. Now, with the availability of precision, high resolution satellite images, data enabling the organization of GIS, combined with the Global Positioning System (GPS), the accuracy and information content of these spatial datasets or maps is extremely high.</p>
<p>Encapsulating these maps and acquired images and provided by various organizations including government, academic and private sectors in Karnataka into a organized repository and provide access to all users for various developmental needs is the need of the hour. There are new innovative ways of technological innovation in allowing us to capture, store, process and display an unprecedented amount of valuable geographical and spatial information about Society and a wide variety of environmental and cultural phenomena. It is the vision of National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) that current and accurate spatial data must be readily available to contribute to local, state and national development and contribute to economic growth, environmental quality and stability, and social progress.</p>
<p>The emphasis is made on information transparency and sharing, with the recognition that spatial information is a national resource and citizens, society, private enterprise and government have a right to access it, appropriately. Only through common conventions and technical agreements, standards, metadata definitions, network and access protocols will be easily possible for this vision to come into existence. In realizing the vision of NSDI and requirements of various state government agencies, Karnataka state through Karnataka State Council of Science and Technology (KSCST) has decided to establish the state level spatial data infrastructure. The Council with the support DST-GoI and DST - GoK initiated to develop a Geoportal and Data Clearing House to discover/ access spatial data sets useful in the local level planning process through Karnataka State Spatial Data Infrastructure (KSSDI) Project. The geo-portal is expected to serve as a centralized hub for other spatial data generating agencies in the State. Web-enabled centralized database of various existing spatial, attribute or statistical data has been generated at KSCST, Bangalore.</p>
<h3>About Karnataka Geoportal</h3>
<p>Karnataka State level Spatial Data Infrastructure (KSSDI) called Karnataka Geoportal is a centralized single window access mechanism for all the spatial data acquired by various agencies in Government of Karnataka using State's resources primarily to support planning activities of the Panchayath Raj Institutions (PRIs), district/state line departments, Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and civil society organizations in the State. KSSDI is an Internet based GIS Directory for the state that eventually will be extended for the use of the society in exploring the information related to state geography, demography, agro and socio economy, and infrastructure facilities.</p>
<p>Spatial datasets generated, maintained and provided by various concerned Line Departments of the State Government, academia, private or civil society organizations of Karnataka are proposed to be made accessible through the project data clearinghouse mechanism. In the future the site can also be extended to cater to sale and purchase of data online. All the data would be shared through the Open GIS Consortium (OGC) recommended standards.</p>
<p>The available data would be catalogued and the search for availability of any particular dataset would be made available through specially customized metadata (data about the data) utility. In this architecture, KSSDI Gateway and its user interface allow a user to query distributed collections of spatial information through their metadata descriptions. This spatial information may take the form of "data" or of services available to interact with spatial data on the different data server, described with complementary forms of metadata. A user interested in locating spatial information uses a search user interface, fills out a search form, specifying queries for data with certain properties. The search request is passed to the database Server, which shall search the Metadata repository on its end. The datasets fulfilling the search criteria will be displayed to the user, on users request the same can be accessed from the Agency Server.</p>
<p>The KSSDI Data clearing house and geo-portal would act gateway for various data generating agencies to share the information across various government departments, NGOs, academies, industries and scientific organisation. It will be a Single window system for discovery, view and access state geo-spatial data sets along with attributes. The individual departments and KSCST would be able to add and update the state geo-spatial data sets thereby providing the up-to-date spatial data dictionary and map directory for the state and facilitate decision support system and helps in local level planning. Thus, KSSDI would provide scientific approach to the decision makers, planners and administrators to facilitate common man usage of valuable Geo-spatial data. Also, the proprietary data prepared by department can also be used for the data sale and purchase, which can be part of the state revenue generation.</p>
<p>The complete KSSDI portal is developed using the ERDAS Apollo Software, an OGC compliant with facilities to share the vector and raster datasets through WMS, WFS and WRS web services along with the solutions and products from IBM for server hardware, storage, backup and retrieval systems, CISCO for the Networking components and Oracle for RDBMS requirements, respectively.</p>
