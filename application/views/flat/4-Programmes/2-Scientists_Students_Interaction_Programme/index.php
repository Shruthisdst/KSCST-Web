<h1>Scientists Students Interaction Programme (SSIP)</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In order to improve the quality of education in the State especially in rural areas, it is felt necessary to introduce some effective programme in schools and colleges. This would help in creating awareness in the students and improve their career to undertake science as profession. Some of the programmes have been already under implementation by Government of Karnataka. Inspired by the successful programmes like "Mahithi Sindhu" and the extension lecture programme of Indian Institute of Science, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology has taken a decision to conduct programmes of interaction of students with scientists in the schools and colleges throughout the state. This programme is called the Scientists Students interaction Programme (SSIP).</p>
<p>This programme was experimented on one occasion and it was successful. The students were excited to be with the scientists and participated actively by posing a large number of questions. It is felt that this is one of the way of popularising science and technology in many schools in the State as well as ignite the curiosity of Students. This will also motivate the students to go in for basic science education.</p>
<h3>Objectives of SSIP</h3>
<ul>
	<li>To Promote active involvement of students and teachers in scientific activity.</li>
	<li>To encourage students to ask questions and doubts in many areas of science and promote their effective participation.</li>
	<li>To enable students to know about the latest developments in the fields of science and technology.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>The programme will have students as participants from several schools/colleges and high schools and pre-university colleges. Major participants will be from Mahithi Sindhu schools. Several resource persons from different disciplines will form the panel. They will be chosen from research institutions like Indian Institute of Science, national laboratories, leading educational institutions etc. In order to break the ice, there may be short presentation by experts. After this, interaction will begin with questions from students. During this discussion students can ask questions and clarify their doubts.</p>
<p>The programme will be bilingual in both Kannada and English. The entire duration will be 3 - 4 hours. Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology shall organize this programme. Directorate of State Education Research and Training takes the responsibility for selecting and bringing the students for the programme and the nodal agency to organize this programme. They will be assisted by the District Institution for Education at the district level.</p>
