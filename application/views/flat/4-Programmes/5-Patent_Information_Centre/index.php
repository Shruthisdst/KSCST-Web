<h1>KSCST : Patent Information Centre</h1>

<p>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection plays a key role in gaining an advantageous position in the competitive technology game for achieving economic growth. Karnataka enjoys large scientific human resources in India with state of the art research and technology centres and scientific establishments in the country. Bangalore, the capital of the state of Karnataka is an acclaimed information technology centre of the world repute. Thus information on various technological advancements should be disseminated to the users of technology in order for our country to develop faster. Thus a culture to make aware of development of technology to pertinent users is essential. This has become more pronounced in the globalised economy with international agreements and obligations in the fields of IPR in the WTO regime. Huge information is to be provided while filing a patent application in order to ensure full disclosure of the invention. Thus, the patent information provides the large single source of technical information in the world today. However, access to this information and other facilities related to IPR are really inadequately available in the academic and other institutions in India.</p>
<p>As a first step in this direction to provide patent related services particularly to the S&amp;T community, Patent Facilitation Centre started functioning under Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council of Department of Science and Technology, Government of India - a few years back. As a state level extension patent information centre was set up at Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore for Karnataka State. The centre started functioning from 31<sup>st</sup> of March 2005 as a service centre to render IPR related services among S &amp; T community.</p>
